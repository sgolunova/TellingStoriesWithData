# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for this final project includes consumers, cybersecurity professionals, and organizations interested in data privacy and the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Specifically, it is aimed at individuals who may not be fully aware of the risks associated with the growing adoption of IoT devices in their homes or workplaces. This includes everyday consumers who own smart devices such as smart speakers, thermostats, wearables, and other connected gadgets, as well as businesses integrating IoT technology into their operations. The goal is to inform this audience about the increasing vulnerabilities posed by IoT devices, the risks of potential cyberattacks, and the importance of taking preventive measures. By raising awareness about IoT security threats and providing clear, digestible data visualizations, the project seeks to empower users to make more informed decisions regarding the devices they buy and how they protect their personal and organizational data.
