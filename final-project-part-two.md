# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for this final project includes consumers, cybersecurity professionals, and organizations interested in data privacy and the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Specifically, it is aimed at individuals who may not be fully aware of the risks associated with the growing adoption of IoT devices in their homes or workplaces. This includes everyday consumers who own smart devices such as smart speakers, thermostats, wearables, and other connected gadgets, as well as businesses integrating IoT technology into their operations. The goal is to inform this audience about the increasing vulnerabilities posed by IoT devices, the risks of potential cyberattacks, and the importance of taking preventive measures. By raising awareness about IoT security threats and providing clear, digestible data visualizations, the project seeks to empower users to make more informed decisions regarding the devices they buy and how they protect their personal and organizational data. 

To narrow down my target audience further, I’ve chosen early adopters—those who are always on the cutting edge of technology, quick to integrate the latest devices and innovations into their lives. This persona is crucial because early adopters not only influence wider consumer trends but also face the earliest and most pronounced risks of new vulnerabilities, especially in the IoT space.


## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask.


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Understand the first impression     |What was your first impression of the website?                  |
|Make sure my story is presented as intended      |How would you describe the purpose of the website in your own words?                 |
|Understand whats working      | Was the information about IoT vulnerabilities clear and easy to understand?                 |
|Critique on the Cases      |Did you find the examples, such as the Mirai Botnet Attack and Google Nest vulnerabilities, helpful?|
|Critique on my dataa Viz      |Did the data visualizations add to the story? and did you find them useful?|
| Understand whats not working     |What would you change|


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

A recurring theme in the feedback was the need for better data visualization. Although the visual data aids in telling the story, some graphs were clipped or lacked clarity, diminishing their effectiveness. Simplifying the presentation of certain statistics and ensuring all visual elements are fully visible would make the information more accessible to a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with technical details. Overall, this feedback suggests that while the website is on the right track, slight adjustments in visual clarity and layout could significantly enhance its ability to communicate important security risks to users.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (M24 College Student) | F23 Works in healthcare| F24 Employes in the Arts |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What was your first impression of the website?| Change title colors, visually appealing, intersting read |Lots of animations| Graphically appealing, lots of animations.|
|How would you describe the purpose of the website in your own words?|spread awareness on IoT vulnerabilities and how much worse it could get.|The purpose is to let the audeince know about the vulnerabilites of IoT and how they've been exploited to be better prepared.|To warn me about vulnerabilites in IoT devices|
|Was the information about IoT vulnerabilities clear and easy to understand?|  yes |I think so | Yes, not much jargon            |
|Did you find the examples, such as the Mirai Botnet Attack and Google Nest vulnerabilities, helpful?| yes, added to the story| yea, added to the story| Yes, very useful|
|Did the data visualizations add to the story? and did you find them useful?| Better labels, first graph isn't visually appealing, the numbers are clipped| I think they added, but need to be better labeled| Yes yes|
|What would you change?| The 64 billion callout doesn't make much of an impact, fix visualizations| better labeling to make it more clear and simple to more lay audiences| Part with the images should be smoother, work on rendering. Data and text are good. |

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Better Data Viz| Label axis better, just better labeling in general|
|Smoothness of Shorthand                                          |  Work on renderng the images better to make transitions more smooth.|                                                
|Completness                                          | Finish all the text blocks |
