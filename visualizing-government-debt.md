_As before, this template provides some of the structure you should have for your assignment, but the official instructions and guidance can be found on Canvas.  Make sure to reference that for detailed instructions on what you need to do and what you need to submit to get credit._

## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

## Working with Tableau

## Part three: create your own visualization

<script type='module' src='https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau.embedding.3.latest.min.js'></script><tableau-viz id='tableau-viz' src='https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/t/sgolunov-93ce664886/views/DataViz1_17255819596310/debttogdp' width='1280' height='625' hide-tabs toolbar='bottom' ></tableau-viz>

The first image uses a line chart to compare the Debt-to-GDP ratio of Japan (highlighted in dark blue) against other countries from 1995 to 2019. The y-axis represents the average Debt-to-GDP ratio, while the x-axis marks the years. This visualization effectively demonstrates the trend of Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio, showing a significant increase over the years. It clearly stands out compared to other countries, whose ratios are shown with lighter lines, emphasizing Japan's unique economic trajectory. I noticed this and wanted to compare Japan's trajectory to other countries who typically are associated with a strong economy. This highlights Japan making it unique in comparison to the other two charts. The line chart offers a clear and continuous view of the trend for individual countries over time, making it easy to track changes and patterns year by year. It is particularly useful for identifying long-term trends and comparing the trajectory of one country against others. In contrast, the heatmap provides a more immediate snapshot of multiple countries' data across several years. It excels at showing relative differences and similarities between countries at specific points in time, though it may not convey trends as clearly as a line chart.

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart.  Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
