# Critique by Design
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

I chose this specific visualization because I thought the data was very interesting. I am currently 22 years old and a lot of my peers post-graduation are starting to settle down and get married. I on the other hand, am foucsing on furthering my education. This specific data set and graphic was very appealing to me because it shows the differences in median age of first marriage in the United States and which is condusive to an interesting comparison between different states. I also thought that the graphic was well created and thought out so it would be a challenging redesign exercise. Although the data almost made for a map, I wanted to see if I could do something else with it. 

## Step two: the critique

The visualization works well in terms of providing a general snapshot of marriage trends for women across the U.S. The clean and simple design makes it accessible and easy to interpret for most viewers. The one thing with this map is that it is not telling a story, we see the numbers of median age of first marriage, but this information is lacking depth of answering any questions. For example, why is there a difference in these medians. Likewise the visualization is just a little boring, its communicating information but not in a way thats making me want to know more about these stats.  What worked well were the map layout which is a familiar way for us to digest data and information, I also liked the interactive element of hovering over and seeing the individual information for every state. What didn't work was the colors of the gradient, I would've personally inverted the colors or chosen a more contrasting gradient to show the contrast between states. Likewise lack of context makes the map feel flat. What I would do differently is use different colors that would be in relation to the US median instead of breaking up the gradient based on the ages. That would add another layer to the data visualization story and when first looking at the chart would show how some states are much higher than the median age while others have a much lower age. This would also the states to be in comparison and add a dynamic level to the visualization instead of having just static statistics that are a little boring. Finally, there is always a problem, as we discussed in class, about using maps to visualize data. When using maps, it is hard to distinguish population, for example at a quick glance you can see that most of the states get married before the age of 28. However the median age of 28 tells a different story, the most populous states in the country, California, NY, and Florida all have a median marriage age of >28, but since most of the Midwest, the largest region, of the United States is rural, it doesn't seem as such. Therefore, this map is not telling the whole story due to the nature of map visualizations not accounting for population. Two changes I would make is 1.) Add a more contrasting color palette to make state differences easier to perceive. 2.) Maybe use a time series line graph to show how the median marriage age changes over time. I could divide the country into regions and observe the data in that manner. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask: 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
